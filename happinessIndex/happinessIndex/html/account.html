            <h2>Welcome to your Employee Happiness Detection Software</h2>
            <p>
                This software allows for you to manage the overall health of your employees. You can see their overall sentiment score on a scale of 100.<br />
                If the employee ever has their score drop more than 20 points within a day, they will be prompted to respond to a survey to see what affected their experience that day. <br /><br />
                This allows for actionable management and feedback on the days that are especially difficult for your employees.
